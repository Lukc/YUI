Yeay User Interface
===================

Alternate Names
---------------

  - YUI User Interface
  - Yui’s User Interface (although I cannot tell who Yui is)

Description
-----------

A work in progress. I started it thinking “Why not?”.

But it’s supposed to be a somewhat declarative GUI library, inspired by
minor projects like yaoui or HTML.

Usage
=====

Nope. Nope nope nope. We’re not done yet.

But basically, you run `yui.init()`, you load a few fonts with
`yui:loadFont()`, and then you create windows (with `ui.Window`),
and then you `yui.run(aTableOfYourWindows)` until it doesn’t work anymore.

Clear instructions will come later.
