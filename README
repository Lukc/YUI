Yeay User Interface
===================

Alternate Names
---------------

  - YUI User Interface
  - Yui’s User Interface (although I cannot tell who Yui is)

Description
-----------

A work in progress. I started it thinking “Why not?”.

But it’s supposed to be a somewhat declarative GUI library, inspired by
minor projects like yaoui or HTML.

Usage
=====

```lua
local yui = require "yui.init"

yui.init()

yui:loadFont("default", "DejaVuSans.ttf", 18)

local w = yui.Window {
	width = 800,
	height = 600,

	yui.Label "It works!"
}

while yui:run {w} do end
```

You can use other widgets, like `yui.Button`, `yui.Frame`, `yui.Column`,
`yui.Row` and `yui.TextInput`. Each of them have particular properties. You
can look at their (commented and documented) source files for more information.
Or build the documentation with LDoc.
